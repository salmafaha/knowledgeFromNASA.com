                <h2>NASA Captures the First Image from the James Webb Space Telescope!</h2>
                <p class="random">The dawn of a new era in astronomy has begun as the world gets its first look at the
                    full capabilities of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, a partnership with ESA (European Space
                    Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). The telescope’s first full-color images and spectroscopic
                    data were released during a televised broadcast at 10:30 a.m. EDT (14:30 UTC) on Tuesday, July 12,
                    2022, from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. These listed targets below
                    represent the first wave of full-color scientific images and spectra the observatory has gathered,
                    and the official beginning of Webb’s general science operations. They were selected by an
                    international committee of representatives from NASA, ESA, CSA, and the Space Telescope Science
                    Institute.</p>

                <p class="random">This landscape of “mountains” and “valleys” speckled with glittering stars is actually
                    the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region called NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula. Captured in
                    infrared light by NASA’s new James Webb Space Telescope, this image reveals for the first time
                    previously invisible areas of star birth.</p>

                <p class="random">Called the Cosmic Cliffs, Webb’s seemingly three-dimensional picture looks like craggy
                    mountains on a moonlit evening. In reality, it is the edge of the giant, gaseous cavity within NGC
                    3324, and the tallest “peaks” in this image are about 7 light-years high. The cavernous area has
                    been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely
                    massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image.
